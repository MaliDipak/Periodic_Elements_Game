# Periodic Elements Game
## Discription :-
    Here, I have made a 'Periodic Elements Game' using C language. This is my fourth mini project.

Periodic Elements Game, is console based game in which an element name is given and the game ask's you to enter the atomic number of that element. If you enter the right answer then your score will be inscreased, otherwise you lose one life out of five. This is very interesting game, this will help you in increasing your knowledge of periodic elements.

I have used C programing language to create this game. I have used userdefine functions, switch case and loop concept through out the code.
